# Move Tracks
This folder holds some code to move DECIM8 using the IR controller.

The code for the button presses mainly comes from the [ev3dev-lang-cpp demo code](https://github.com/ddemidov/ev3dev-lang-cpp/tree/master/demos).

The code for following the IR beacon is mine.  Feedback is super welcome.
